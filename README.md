Q111----001-TEMPLATE
====================

Clean Template for starting development on LAPIS ML610Q111 MCU

This code was written specifically for the ML610Q111 mcu on the LAPIS Development Platform, 
but should be good example code for anyone writting code for any of the ML610Q1xx family 
of microcontrollers.

This template will demonstrate how to use the internal peripherials of this "Q111" mcu.

Hope this helps!

Best Regards,
Carl
